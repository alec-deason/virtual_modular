This is an experimental software modular synth and livecoding environment intended to be used for dynamic music in interactive projects. In it's current form it's extremely exploratory and mostly just a proving ground for ideas, but it can be used to make sounds. Take a look at the examples or these videos about the system: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQqrjK5qmuoLXUd0Euq14WA

There is a playlist of tracks made using this tool here: https://soundcloud.com/user-166463215/sets/realtime-synth
